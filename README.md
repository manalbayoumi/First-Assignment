Crowdfunding deals with methods of gathering donations from the public. These donations achieve different projects related to food, food trucks, technology, web, theatre, music, film and video, publishing, games, journalism, etc. We draw three conclusions from crowdfunding campaigns: first, a successful campaign depends on the type of project we are asking the public to sponsor and whether the public is for the project or not. Second, successful campaigns require a lot of backers that decide the amount of investment needed to fund the project. For example, Melton, Robinson, and Fritz project sponsored technology and was successful because it had about 1425 backers. Third, successful campaigns are longer, and reaching their goals is more successful than shorter ones; for example, Wright, Hunt, and Rowe have a short four-day campaign despite having many backers (Clark, 2019).
Furthermore, this dataset has several limitations, such as this data may not represent all the projects in different crowdfunding companies. If that data comes from various companies, there should be more spreadsheets for all the projects. There is another limitation, such as inaccurate or incomplete data, which may cause investors to lose their investments and make backers unable to encourage investors to invest in these projects. Also, using old or outdated data may prevent the crowdfunding company from losing its funding from the public, and that causes significant damage to the reputation of these companies (Capone, 2021).
Finally, we could create more Pivot tables to show the relationship between the goal that the projects set and what is pledged. Also, we could develop a pie chart showing these projects' outcomes. We should set up more charts, whether x and y scatter charts or area charts, to show which projects these companies should encourage the public to invest more in. We can add software to Excel, such as Analytic Solver, to analyze the data to compare these projects, seek to invest in successful projects, and find ways to transform the failed projects into successful ones. All of that will aim to encourage more successful projects, eliminate failed projects, and make the crowdfunding campaign achieve its goal.

1. When looking at the data here, the median is a better way to summarize it because it is the value in the middle when the data is arranged in ascending order. Even though the mean is a standard measure method, it is influenced by large and small amounts of data. Whether using the mean or median depends on the type of data. For selling homes, we use the median (Camm et al., 2019).

2. There is more variability with successful campaigns than unsuccessful ones; the data for the successful campaign is influenced by having more backers that encouraged the success of the various projects. That makes sense because when we look at successful campaigns, the measure is about 360496, higher than the failed one. The variability is measured by three aspects: the range, calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value in a data. There is also the standard deviation, which is the positive square root of the variance, and in calculating the variability, the variance is based on the mean deviation  (Camm et al., 2019, p. 44-47).
From the box plot, we see the failed and successful outcome. The Box and Whisker best represent and emphasize the outcome of successful and failed campaigns. We see the minimum, median, and maximum for the failed and successful campaigns as stressed by the graph. We also see the first and third quartiles.
